## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any other algorithms).

ANSWER: The purpose of the analysis was to see evaluate the loan_status of creditors. The goal of using the model was see if individals have more of an healthy loan or high risk loan. So a Logistic Regression model was used to predict if creditors had a healthy loan or high risk loan status. 

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
    * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
    
ANSWER: *The accuarcy score is about 90%. The precision score is 85%. The Recall score is approximately 91%. Since the accuracy score is 90% that means that the model is doing well in close observations but the model is not 100% accurate. 

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:

* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

ANSWER: From the machine learning models the models that seems to perform best seems to be deep learning. The logistic regression model can help predict outcomes from the data and find the threshold but the results are not completely accurate. The performance of the model does depend on the problem we are trying to solve. The type of predictions we are trying to make may require a type of model that can specifically find the data we need. 

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
